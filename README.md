# MTG-Inventory-Manager

A personal project I use to keep track of the value of my MTG inventory.  This requires a private key from TGC player which is not included here.  I am not sure if I will find a work around for this in the future.

REQUIRES:

config.txt: 
CLIENT_ID  
CLIENT_SECRET  

requests:
python -m pip install requests

I wanted to practice with Python since I hadn't written anything in a while.  The code is a bit hacky and probably doesn't follow Python best practices.
